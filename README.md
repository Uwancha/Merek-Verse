# Old Abilitax Repository

This repository contains the initial version of Abilitax, a curated learning platform aimed at curating and providing organized resources, across the internet, for individuals seeking in-demand skills like web development, data science, UX/UI, and more. The project began with technologies such as React.js, TypeScript, Redux, CSS, Firebase, and Vite.

## Project Overview

Abilitax was initially developed using the following stack:

- **React.js**
  
- **TypeScript** 

- **Redux** 
  
- **CSS** 

- **Firebase** 

- **Vite** 

## Why the Shift to Next.js?

As the project progressed, a decision was made to shift from Vite to Next.js for improved page optimization and SEO benefits. This transition involved creating a new repository and directory structure to accommodate the changes.

## New Repository

The development focus has now shifted to a new repository using the Next.js framework. Please refer to the [new Abilitax repository](https://github.com/Uwancha/AbiliTax) for the latest version of the project, which includes optimizations and enhancements.
